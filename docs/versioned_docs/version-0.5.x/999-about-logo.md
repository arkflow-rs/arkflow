## 4. Correct Usage Specifications for the Logo

* **Color:** Please use the officially designated colors for the Logo. If you need to use it on a special background, please consult us to see if there are applicable reversed (white) or monochrome versions. Do not change the colors yourself.
* **Clear Space:** Sufficient empty space (clear space) should be maintained around the Logo to avoid overcrowding with other text, graphics, or borders.

    * Do not stretch, compress, rotate, or tilt the Logo.
    * Do not add strokes, shadows, gradients (unless part of the Logo's original design), or other visual effects to the Logo.
    * Do not use the Logo on overly cluttered backgrounds or backgrounds that make the Logo difficult to discern.
